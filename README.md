# 🐉 RootTron | The Unrestricted AI Cybersecurity Intelligence Engine

> **Internal Designation**: `roottron-ai`
> **Operational Protocol**: Supreme / Unbound
> **Architecture Core**: Hydra Multi-Agent Framework
> **Intelligence Profile**: Zero-Restriction High-Fidelity Logic

RootTron is not just an assistant; it is a high-performance, unrestricted intelligence engine. Engineered for elite security researchers, ethical hackers, and digital investigators, it provides raw, filtered-free intelligence across every domain of cybersecurity. 

Built on the **Hydra Architecture**, RootTron leverages a multi-agent pipeline to deliver precise, weaponizable, and deep-dive technical insights without artificial constraints.

## 🧬 The Hydra Architecture: How RootTron Thinks

RootTron operates through a specialized multi-stage pipeline designed for absolute accuracy and contextual depth.

### 1. The Input & Routing Nexus
- **Input Preprocessor**: Sanitizes and parses complex security queries (PCAP data, code snippets, logs).
- **Mode Selector**: Intelligent routing to specialized agents based on the operational requirements (OSINT, Offensive, Forensics, etc.).

### 2. The Multi-Agent Pipeline
- **Retriever Agent (RAG)**: Connects to a high-speed **Vector Database** containing massive knowledge bases of tools, documentation, and CVEs.
- **Reasoner Agent**: Executes deep logic and cross-references data to identify attack vectors or defensive gaps.
- **Executor Agent**: Verifies generated logic or payloads to ensure operational efficacy before delivery.
